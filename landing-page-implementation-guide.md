**Complete Build Instructions with Cursor Prompts**

**Time Required**: 6-8 hours  
**AI Assistance**: 90% code generated by Cursor  
**Prerequisites**: Project structure from Week 1 Day 1

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps in order. Each step includes a **Cursor prompt** you can copy-paste directly.

---

## Step 1: Create Page Structure (30 min)

### 1.1: Create Landing Page Route

**Cursor Prompt** (Composer Mode - `Cmd+I`):

```
Create a landing page route for my travel platform:

File: frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx

Requirements:
1. Main landing page component
2. Import and render these sections in order:
   - Navbar (sticky at top)
   - HeroSection
   - ProblemSection
   - FeaturesSection
   - HowItWorksSection
   - SocialProofSection
   - ComparisonSection
   - BetaCTASection
   - Footer

3. Each section has an id for nav scrolling:
   - hero, problem, features, how-it-works, social-proof, comparison, beta-cta

4. Add smooth scroll behavior
5. Use React 18 with TypeScript
6. Use Material-UI v6 for styling
7. Mobile responsive

For now, create placeholder components that just show their names.
We'll implement each section next.

Generate:
1. LandingPage.tsx
2. Placeholder components for each section
3. index.ts exports
```

### 1.2: Update Router

**Cursor Prompt** (Chat):

```
Update React Router to make LandingPage the home route:

File: frontend/src/App.tsx

Add:
- Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />}
- Keep existing routes for /signup, /login, etc.
- LandingPage should NOT have the main app layout (no sidebar)

Generate updated App.tsx
```

3. Shadow appears when scrolled

4. Desktop Layout (>768px):
   - Logo on left: "My-Travel-Agent" text logo
   - Nav links center: Features | How It Works | Compare
   - CTA button right: "Join Beta" (primary color button)

5. Mobile Layout (<768px):
   - Logo on left
   - Hamburger menu icon on right
   - Drawer opens with nav links + CTA

6. Scroll behavior:
   - Clicking nav links scrolls smoothly to section
   - Use section ids: #features, #how-it-works, #comparison

7. Styling:
   - Material-UI AppBar, Toolbar, Button, Drawer
   - Logo: Bold text, primary color
   - Nav links: Text buttons
   - CTA: Contained button, rounded
